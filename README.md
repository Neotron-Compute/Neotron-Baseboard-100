# Neotron-Baseboard-100

The Neotron Baseboard 100 is an micro-ATX Neotron motherboard, with Neotron CPU Socket and 4x Neotron Expansion Slots.

You must fit a Neotron CPU card for this board to function (or attach a microcontroller dev-kit of your choice using jumper wires).

### CPU Socket

The CPU is fitted to a second PCB 'CPU card' which plugs into a socket on the motherboard. We have designed a special 80-pin socket pinout, which provides all the signals for required for the standard peripherals available in this design.

The socket is basically two 2x20 pin headers, placed 130 mil apart. This should give enough space to fit even a TQFP-176 microcontroller and some TSOP-54 SDRAM.

### Expansion Socket

The expansion socket allows you to add on I²C or SPI based devices at a later date. It provides a single chip-select and a single IRQ line - the motherboard design should ensure each socket gets a unique signal for each of these. Each expansion device should also contain a AT24C256 or similar EEPROM device. To allow these EEPROM devices to be scanned, each slot also contains three `EEPROM_ADDRESS` pins, tied to Vcc or GND in a unique combination. These should be connected through to the EEPROM address lines on your AT24C256, thus ensuring that each expansion card has its EEPROM at a unique address.

The expansion slot is a simple 2x10 header. We suggest the use of a TE card-edge connector.

The pin functions are:

```
     SPI_COPI   1    2   GND
     SPI_CIPO   3    4   GND
      SPI_CLK   5    6   GND
      ~SPI_CS   7    8   ~IRQ
      I2C_SDA   9   10   I2C_SCL
 EEPROM_ADDR0   11  12   EEPROM_ADDR1
 EEPROM_ADDR2   13  14   ~RESET
           5V   15  16   5V
          3V3   17  18   3V3
          GND   19  20   GND
```
