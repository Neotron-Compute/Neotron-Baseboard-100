# Neotron-Baseboard-100

The Neotron Baseboard 100 is an micro-ATX Neotron motherboard, with Neotron CPU Socket and 4x Neotron Expansion Slots.

You must fit a Neotron CPU card for this board to function (or attach a microcontroller dev-kit of your choice using jumper wires).

### CPU Socket

The CPU can either be designed to solder direct to your particular motherboard design, or it can be fitted to a second PCB 'CPU card' which plugs into a socket on the motherboard. We have designed a special 80-pin socket pinout, which provides all the signals for required for the standard peripherals available in this design.

The socket is basically two 2x20 pin headers, placed 130 mil apart. This should give enough space to fit even a TQFP-176 microcontroller and some TSOP-54 SDRAM.

The pins are labelled in row.column fashion, i.e. 1.1 is top left, 1.20 is top right and 4.20 is bottom right.

## Expansion

The (up-to) seven expansion sockets allow you to add on I²C or SPI based devices at a later date. Each provides a single chip-select and a single IRQ line - the motherboard design should ensure each socket gets a unique signal for each of these. Each expansion device should also contain a AT24C256 or similar EEPROM device. To allow these EEPROM devices to be scanned, each slot also contains three `EEPROM_ADDRESS` pins, tied to Vcc or GND in a unique combination. These should be connected through to the EEPROM address lines on your AT24C256, thus ensuring that each expansion card has its EEPROM at a unique address - 0x50 on Slot 0 through to a maximum possible 0x57 for Slot 7. Where your board has on-board devices, you should fit an AT24C256 EEPROM for each device so that the on-board devices can be discovered, exactly as if they were on an expansion card.

The expansion slot is a simple 2x10 header. We suggest the use of a TE card-edge connector, but you could equally use two 1x10 pin-headers if desired.

The pin functions are:

```
     SPI_COPI   1    2   GND
     SPI_CIPO   3    4   GND
      SPI_CLK   5    6   GND
      ~SPI_CS   7    8   ~IRQ
      I2C_SDA   9   10   I2C_SCL
 EEPROM_ADDR0   11  12   EEPROM_ADDR1
 EEPROM_ADDR2   13  14   ~RESET
           5V   15  16   5V
          3V3   17  18   3V3
          GND   19  20   GND
```

## Expansion Ideas

Why not design and build your own expansion card? You could try designing:

* A dual Atari/SEGA 9-pin Joypad Interface
* An Ethernet card, e.g. with an ENC28J60 SPI/Ethernet interface IC
* A Mikro Eletronika Click adaptor, allow many of the range of [Click board](https://www.mikroe.com/click) to be fitted
* A Wi-Fi/Bluetooth card, using an Espressif ESP32
* A second processor card - perhaps with a RISC-V microcontroller, or classic Zilog Z80
* An OPL2 or OPL3 based FM synthesiser card
* An ISA adaptor card (taking an ISA card at right-angles, i.e. parallel to the base board) - a simple microcontroller should be able to bit-bang the ISA bus at 8 MHz and offer an SPI peripheral interface to the Neotron Expansion Slot
* An IDE interface card, allowing 40-pin IDE Hard Disk Drives and CD-ROM drives to be used - this will be quite similar to an ISA bus adaptor
* A floppy drive controller card - either using an eSPI Super I/O chip, or connecting a legacy ISA bus floppy controller as per the ISA adaptor
* A video card for a second monitor output, perhaps based on the CPLD used in the [VGAtonic](https://hackaday.io/project/6309-vga-graphics-over-spi-and-serial-vgatonic)
